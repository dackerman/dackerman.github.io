So, you want to know more about me, eh?

## Who is this guy?

My name is David Ackerman.  I grew up in semi-rural Southwestern Michigan, and lived there for all of my childhood.

I currently live in the San Francisco Bay area, working as an engineer, constantly learning and tinkering with everything I can get my hands on.  I currently work at [Guidewire Software](http://www.guidewire.com/), but as is the case with most personal blogs, they have nothing to do with what I say here - these are all my thoughts and opinions.

## What's this blog about?

## Can I hire this guy?
